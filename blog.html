                    Local
                    Storage and
                    Session
                    Storage?</h5>
                <p class="card-text">LocalStorage and sessionStorage are almost identical and have the same API.
                    The
                    difference is that with sessionStorage,the data is persisted only until the window or tab is
                    closed. With localStorage, the data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser
                    cache or until your web app clears the data.</p>

                    Scope and
                    Block
                    Scope?
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known
                    as
                    global variables and have global scope.
                    Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
                    function or conditional state
                    can access that variable.
                    <br> <br>
                    Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope
                    of
                    the variables inside the
                    curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
                    something else. You are only
                    allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

                    in
                    JavaScript?
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">An event loop is something that pulls stuff out of the queue and places it
                    onto
                    the function execution stack whenever
                    the function stack becomes empty.
                    The event loop is the secret by which JavaScript gives us an illusion of being multithreaded
                    even though it is
                    single-threaded.Event loop manage synchronous and asynchronous in JS.</p>

                    UNDEFINED?
                </h5>
                <p class="card-text">The undefined is a primitive type in JavaScript.So the undefined is a type
                    and the undefined type has exactly one value
                    that is undefined.<br><br>
                    The ways of getting UNDEFINED are:<br>

                    1. When you declare a variable and don't initialize it to a value, the variable will have a
                    value of undefined.<br>

                    2. If you access a non-existing property of an object, you'll get undefined.<br>

                    3. When you call a function with a number of parameters, you often pass the same number of
                    arguments.Otherwise you will get
                    undefined.<br>

                    4. A function without a return statement or with a return statement but without an
                    expression
                    returns undefined.<br>

                    5. When you access an array element that is out-of-bounds, you'll get the undefined.<br></p>
